# Formal Verification of Neural Networks

### Overview
Supervisor : Pawan Kumar
Student : Jin Yeob Chung @jinyup100

### Introduction
In light of recent interest in the interpretability of neural networks, the purpose of this project is to devise an algorithmic framework that accurately calculates the lower and upper bounds on the outputs of a toy neural network, and eventually on the real network trained on the ACAS dataset.
